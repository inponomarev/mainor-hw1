# Basic algorithms practice

Make the following project compile with `mvn verify`.

## 1. 

Given an integer array a as a parameter, revert the order of elements in this array

Example 1:

Input: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
Output: 5, 4, 3, 2, 1

Input: 1
Output: 1

Input: [] (empty array)
Output: [] (empty array)

----------------------------------------------------

## 2. 

Given a string s, find the first non-repeating character in it and return its index. If it does not exist, return -1.


Example 1:

Input: s = "mainor"
Output: 0

Example 2:

Input: s = "oop"
Output: 2

Example 3:

Input: s = "javajava"
Output: -1

## 3. 

Given a double x and a positive integer number n, return an x to the power of n. (Write your own implementation. Think how to reduce the number of multiplication operations)

---

## 4. 

Given an array of integers, output a maximum value of this array.


Example:  {0, 3, -1, 5, 10, 3, -2}
Output: 10

Example:  {-2}
Output: -2


---

## 5. 

Given an array of integers, output two maximum values of this array.


Example:  {0, 3, -1, 5, 10, 3, -2}
Output: 10, 5

Example:  {1, 2}
Output: 1, 2

FizzBuzz -- a classic coding interview task:

Write a Java program which outputs first 100 integer numbers, but each number divisible by three is replaced by the word "fizz" and any number divisible by five by the word "buzz". Numbers divisible by both three and five become "fizz buzz". (See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz)
